        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Java is one of the most popular programming languages for creating programmes that can run on computers and
          mobile
          devices. Java's Object Oriented Programming runs on multiple devices, making it ideal for developing websites,
          games,
          and mobile apps. It enables a Java programme to be written once and executed on multiple devices. Due to these
          and other
          powerful features, Java has remained one of the three most popular programming languages for the past two
          decades.

          A full-stack Java developer has both front-and back-end development skills and is able to handle different
          aspects of
          the development of web applications. They know Java programming language and related technologies. By
          combining their
          front-end development skills with back-end proficiency in Java, Full-Stack Java developers can create
          end-to-end web
          applications, handle data processing, and deliver seamless user experiences.</p>
        <h5>Why Java?</h5>
        <p>We can summarise why Java is so popular in 5 points as follows:

          1. Java is a very easy language to learn and use compared to other languages.

          2. Java is platform independent language. It works everywhere, in every environment.

          3. Java is an "object-oriented" language. So you can create modular programmes and usable code blocks as if
          you were
          playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

          4. While many othe r languages have specific usage cases, Java's usage case is very wide.

          5. Because of many job opportunities, someone familiar with Java can easily find a job.

          All these features make Java knowledge an invaluable asset for those seeking a career in the software
          industry. TechPro

          skilled and qualified Java developer.</p>

        <h5>Core Java</h5>
        <p>Core Java covers learning the basic features and functions of the Java language. Topics such as the basic
          structure of
          Java, language features, data types, operators, loops, arrays, methods and so on are included in Core Java. In
          addition,
          Core Java often includes Java's object-oriented programming (OOP) features: classes, objects, inheritance,
          polymorphism,
          abstraction and encapsulation.</p>
        <h5>Lambda</h5>
        <p>A lambda expression is an easy way to represent an anonymous function in Java. An unknown function lacks a
          name and can
          be handed as a value. It is a feature introduced in Java 8 as part of the improvements to functional
          programming.</p>
        <h5>Git-GitHub</h5>
        <p>GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories but includes its features. Git is a command line
          application, whereas
          GitHub offers a Web-based graphical interface.
        </p>
        <h5>SQL</h5>
        SQL is the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. The language is used to manage and manipulate relational
        databases. SQL provides a standard interface for interacting with databases and carrying out tasks such as
        creating,
        modifying, and getting data.

        <h5>Advanced Java</h5>
        <p>Advanced Java is everything beyond foundation Java and refers to an expanded range of features and libraries
          developed
          on top of the Java programming language's basis. Generic Types, Multithreading, Serialisation and

          few of the tools and APIs that extend the capabilities of Java for creating enterprise-level applications.
        </p>
        <h5>JDBC</h5>
        <p>JDBC is an abbreviation for Java Database Connection. An API (Application Programming Interface) enables Java
          applications to interact with databases and run database operations. JDBC provides classes and methods for
          connecting to
          databases, running SQL statements, getting and manipulating data, and managing database transactions.
        </p>
        <h5>MongoDB</h5>
        <p>MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system that provides flexible, scalable, and
          high-performance
          document-oriented storage. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not store data using tables
          and fields.
          Instead, BSON (Binary JSON) stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.
        </p>
        <h5>Hibernate</h5>
        <p>Hibernate is a Java framework that facilitates the development of database-aware Java applications. It is a

          image,
          the table, and the form.</p>
        <h5>CSS</h5>
        <p>The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language describes how a web page should look. It lets developers change the
          font,
          colour, spacing, position, and responsiveness of HTML elements, among other things.</p>
        <h5>Bootstrap</h5>
        <p>Bootstrap is an open-source CSS framework that provides pre-built components and style to simplify the
          development of
          the front end. It offers responsive grids, parts of the user interface (e.g., buttons, forms, navigation bars)
          and
          Javascript plugins to create mobile-friendly and visually attractive sites.
        </p>

          full-stack
          development is a very fast-evolving field. To stay current, full-stack developers should strive to learn more
          and be
          open to adapting to changing trends and industry requirements.

          Collaboration and Communication: Full-stack developers must have good communication skills to collaborate
          effectively
          with designers, front-end developers and partners for successful project outcomes.

          Project Management and Time Management: Successful full-stack developers need project management and time
          management
          skills to prioritise and manage multiple tasks efficiently.

          To become a successful full-stack developer, one must possess technical expertise, strong problem-solving
          skills, and a
          willingness to continuously learn and adapt. Full-stack developers are capable of handling both front-end and
          back-end
          development tasks, making them highly versatile professionals in the software industry.
        </p>
        <h5>What exactly does a full-stack developer do?
        </h5>
        <p>A full-stack Java developer is responsible for creating and maintaining the entire web application, like an
          architect
          who plans and constructs a building. This is also similar to a person who cooks and serves a meal from start
          to finish.
          They work with the programming languages, frameworks and libraries used to build websites and web applications
          and
          ensure everything works properly. It is also their responsibility to resolve any errors or problems and make
          sure
          everything is in order.
        </p>
        <h5>What should I do to become a full-stack Java developer?
        </h5>
        <p>The easiest way is to get accurate and professional training with a quality IT training program like TechPro
          Education.
          Achieve the goal most efficiently with suitable learning materials, guidance and discipline. This field is one
          of those
          high-paying careers that can be achieved with a little hard work without a university degree.
        </p>
        <h5>What programs should I learn to become a full-stack Java developer?
        </h5>
        <p>Core Java, SQL, HTML & CSS, React- Bootstrap, Advanced Java, JDBC, Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring MVC,
          Hibernate,
          Restful API, Microservices, Git-GitHub, MongoDB, UnitTest.
        </p>
        <h5>What skills should a full-stack Java developer have?
        </h5>
        <p>Back-end Development: A full-stack Java developer is able to manage server-side programming using Java or
          Java-based
          frameworks like Spring or Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE).

          Database Management: Full-stack Java developers are familiar with database management systems like MySQL,
          PostgreSQL, or
          Oracle.

          Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): In Object-Oriented Programming languages, there are key concepts like
          polymorphism,
          inheritance, and encapsulation that one should be familiar with. Utilizing these structures in a code block to
          meet
          requirements can make applications more flexible and easier to maintain.

          Testing and Debugging: Since writing testable code in the software world and developing the project through
          test
          scenarios is crucial, this need is met through libraries such as Junit.

          User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Development: Front-End Developers specialize in developing the
          user
          interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and web applications.

          Translating Design Mockups or Wireframes: Front-End Developers use programming languages such as HTML
          (Hypertext Markup
          Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create a website's structure, style, and behaviour.

          Integration with Back-End Systems: Front-End Developers collaborate with Back-End Developers to establish
          seamless
          communication between the client-side and server-side components of a web application.

          Responsive Web Design: Front-End Developers ensure that websites are responsive, meaning that they can adapt
          and provide
          optimal user experiences on various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

          By combining their front-end development skills with back-end proficiency in Java, Full-Stack Java developers
          can create
          end-to-end web applications, handle data processing, and deliver seamless user experiences.
